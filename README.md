Berserk Rice

Description
This is a special tribute to Kentura Miruma and his famous manga Berserk. I hold Berserk in high regards because it is one of the manga's that I respect the most. I have learned a lot from just reading it and how much I complain about things then look at Gut's suffering and see how mine compares to nothing. I hope you all enjoy.
